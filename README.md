This project focuses on predicting air quality levels in Bihar using various Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) models implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. The air quality data is collected from various regions in Bihar, and models are trained to predict future air quality levels based on historical data. This project is aimed at providing insights into air pollution trends and helping in devising control measures.
